# LOL-patchs-to-Discord

If Mark Yetter (League of Legends balance team lead) tweet a message including "Patch Preview", its content and images will be forwarded automatically to my Discord.
It will tag people with @LOL on Discord so they get notified as soon as a new patch preview is available.

This project is deprecated for 2 reasons:
- Elon Musk (current tweeter owner) switched the free API routes to retrieve a user tweets to a basic plan that is worth 100$/month.
- Mark Yetter is no longuer balance team lead and his successor doesn't always include "Patch Preview" or any distinguishable keyword.
